		<h1>This is my Homepage</h1>
		
		<p>Welcome to my homepage. I really hope you <em>enjoy your stay</em> because <strong>it took me a long time to write it</strong>.</p> <!--This paragraph uses the em and strong tags.-->
		
		<p>This webpage contains all sorts of information. For example, we will review some abbreviations like <abbr title = "Cascade Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>. What makes this website great, though is that we will also review acronyms like <acronym title = "Stop Online Piracy Act">SOPA</acronym> <cite title = "Wikipedia, Acronyms">as you will find in Wikipedia.</cite></p>
		
		<p>You will also find code! That's right, we love coding and programming. We hope you like it too:<code>echo "Hello World";</code>. In order to start the virtual keyboard, just press <kbd>I</kbd>. The output will be something like <samp>this</samp>. If you want variables, they will be presented <var>like-this</var>.</p>
		
		<p>On the other hand, this <del>is not what you should do</del>, instead <ins>do this!</ins><br /></p><hr />
		
		<h2>This is the Second Part of my Homepage!</h2>
		
		<pre>This is just the second part.
I'm using the pre tag for this, 
so that I can write it on multiple lines</pre>
		
		<p>I'm back to normal now. <sup>Although I still like the sup tag</sup> and even the <sub>sub tag also</sub>...</p>
