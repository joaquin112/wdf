We learned how to use the input type element, how to use textarea and a lot of other cool things.</p>		<p>I liked today's lecture because we also learned how to input data to another website such as Google or Wikipedia. For example, it's possible to send data to Wikipedia and show the user one of Wikipedia's pages.</p>		<p>Useful link of the day: <a href = 'http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/forms/select.html'>HTML Forms</a></p>				<h2>Day 5 - February 9, 2012</h2>				<p>I liked today's lecture. It had a lot of information about tables and tables inside tables. I learned not to use tables for layout because those layouts tend to look really ugly.</p>		<p>An example of a tag I used is the &#60;table&#62;, which allows you to start a table. This tag is really useful and it's used in conjunction with &#60;tr&#62;, &#60;td&#62;; and a few other tags that were discussed during lecture.</p>		<p>Useful link of the day: <a href = 'http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp'>HTML Tables</a></p>		</div>		<div id = "footer">			Copyright &copy;		</div> <!--Close Footer-->			</div> <!--Close Wrapper--></body></html>
