It had a lot of information about tables and tables inside tables. I learned not to use tables for layout because those layouts tend to look really ugly.</p>		<p>An example of a tag I used is the &#60;table&#62;, which allows you to start a table. This tag is really useful and it's used in conjunction with &#60;tr&#62;, &#60;td&#62;; and a few other tags that were discussed during lecture.</p>		<p>Useful link of the day: <a href = 'http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp'>HTML Tables</a></p>		</div>		<div id = "footer">			Copyright &copy;		</div>			</div></body></html>
